# fpga-market-parser
This is a personal project. I have always been interested in Finance, and even almost switched to Finance my first year of University. I decided not to, but my interest still lingered. When I found out there are FPGA engineers in quant firms, I knew I had to make an attempt to work for one out of college.

The project is a market parser that uses a Basys 3 board. This project includes the use of Git, C++, Python, Verilog, and Vivado
